  tags:
    - Groups
  summary: Update a group by ID (PATCH)
  description: >-
    Update a group's information in a directory by `groupId` via `PATCH`.

    You can use this API to manage group membership.


    **Note:** Renaming groups after they've synced to your Atlassian
    organization isn't supported in this 

    release of the User Provisioning API. To rename a group, create a new group
    with the desired 

    name, update membership, and then delete the old group.
