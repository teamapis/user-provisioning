# Cloud Admin User Provisioning API Spec

> The Cloud Admin User Provisioning API schema over time.

The Cloud Admin User Provisioning API documentation is located [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/user-provisioning/rest/intro/) on the Atlassian Developer website.

This **unofficial** repository aims to document the small (or large) changes to the API specification provided by Atlassian for this API.

## What's Here

* `schema-original.json`
  The original json file we downloaded from Atlassian.
* `schema.json`
  A pretty-printed version of `schema-original.json`
* `schema.yaml`
  A YAML representation of `schema.json`
* `modular/`
  A modular version of the API, broken up into multiple YAML files.

## How it works

1. We check the schema regularly for changes.

2. When a change occurs, we update the repository with those changes.

3. We create a release based on when we noticed the change.

Releases are named based on the date **we** first saw the schema changeâ€”they are *not* official release names from Atlassian's perspective.
